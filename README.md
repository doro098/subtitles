Subtitule, a libre website for better subtitles
Disclaimer
This project is currently on alpha and it is proof of concept that we decided to create while we learn to code. It will not exist or be functional for quite some time, nevertheless contribution is highly appreciated.

Purpose
The idea behind this project is to create a community oriented website where people can contribute, discuss, comment and update a central plain text file instead of creating multiple .srt files for the same subtitle. So if you can upload any number of subiles to a website like OpenSubtitles, here you will be able to work on a single text with the help of other people, similar to what Genius does with lyrics. The idea behind this is titles fto create a better repository of subtitles in terms of quality, while also preserving people's privacy and in an environment that will foster open knowledge.
